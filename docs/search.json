    "text": "Rendering a PDF file\n\nOption 1: Render from VS Code (without additional extensions)\nWe recommend using VS Code for this course and for use in developing your Jupyter notebooks. Rendering pdfs from Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code has a couple of extra steps, though. To render a pdf without any additional extensions, you do the following:\n\nOpen your notebook in VS code and hit the ellipsis (the three horizontal dots) just to the right of the tools for your notebook:\n\n\n\nClick “Export”:\n\n\n\nSelect “HTML” (exporting to pdf won’t work without the installation of additional tools):\n\n\n\nOpen the HTML file you just saved in Chrome:\n\n\n\nClick the options button (three vertical dots) and click “print”:\n\n\n\nSelect the destination as “Save as PDF” and click “Save”:\n\n\n\nVoila! You should have a pdf\n\n\n\nOption 2: Render from VS Code with Quarto and LaTeX\nYou can save a lot of the above steps if you’re willing to install 2 things: 1. Install Quarto, which is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system (great for making websites and blogs for your professional portfolio). 2. Install the Quarto VS Code extension 3. Install a version of tex for your operating system. 4. Once you do this, you can directly export your documents to pdf:\n\n\n\nOption 3: Render from Jupyter Notebooks\nOpen your notebook in a Jupyter Notebook in Google Chrome. Go to File-&gt;Print Preview, then after verifying the document looks correct, click “print” and for your printer choose “Save as PDF.”\nWhichever method you choose - always check your pdf before submitting to make sure everything is rendered and nothing is cut off!",

    "section": "Example Question and Response",
    "text": "Example Question and Response\nBelow is an example question to demonstrate how to answer a question using a Jupyter notebook.\nCalculate the (a) first and (b) second derivative of \\(f(t) = t^3\\). lastly, (c) numerically evaluate the second derivative for \\(t=3\\). If \\(t\\) represents time (seconds) and \\(f\\) represents distance of a ball over time (in meters), then (d) what does the second derivative at \\(t=3\\) mean?\nANSWER\nThe first and second derivatives are calculated as follows:\n(a) The first derivative is: \\[ \\frac{df}{dt} = 3t^2\\]\n(b) The second derivative is: \\[ \\frac{d^2f}{dt^2} = 6t\\]\n(c) We calculate the second derivative at time \\(t=3\\) as follows:\n\n# (c) Numerically evaluate the second derivative for f(x)\n\n# Initialize variables for the analysis\nt = 3\n\n# Compute the derivative\ndf2 = 6 * t\n\nprint('(c) The second derivative at t = 3 is {}'.format(df2))\n\n(c) The second derivative at t = 3 is 18\n\n\n(d) This derivative, which is the second derivative of distance with respect to time represents the acceleration of the ball in \\(m^2\\) per second. This shows how quickly the ball is increasing its speed over time.\n\nFigure Example:\nHere is an example of a well-prepared figure that checks all of the requirements for good figures. To demonstrate we’ll start by loading some data to plot (the example here is from the lecture on bias-variance tradeoff):\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pickle\n\n# Load the data for plotting\ndatafilename = './plot_example_data/data.pkl'\ninfile = open(datafilename,'rb')\nloaded_data = pickle.load(infile)\ninfile.close()\n\n# Store the loaded data in convenient variable names\nkvalues = loaded_data['kvalues']\nerror_training = loaded_data['error_training']\nerror_testing = loaded_data['error_testing']\nerror_bayesclf = loaded_data['error_bayesclf']\n\n# Choose colors that will be distinguishable from one another\ncolor0 = '#121619' # Dark grey\ncolor1 = '#00B050' # Green\ncolor2 = '#7c7c7c' # Light grey\n\nThen, we create the plot:\n\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' # Make clear on high-res screens\n\n# Create the plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(7,5), dpi= 100) # Adjust the figure size and dots per inch \nplt.semilogx(kvalues,error_training,color=color0,label='Training (in-sample)')\nplt.semilogx(kvalues,error_testing,color=color1,label='Test (out-of-sample)')\nplt.semilogx(kvalues,error_bayesclf,'--',color=color2,label='Bayes (optimal)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid('on')\nplt.xlabel('k nearest neighbors') # Always use X and Y labels\nplt.ylabel('Binary Classification Error Rate')\nplt.axis([1,200,0,0.5]) # Ensure the axis is the right size for the plot data\nplt.tight_layout() # Use this to maximize the use of space in the figure\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the clear x and y axis labels and legends - there are no acronyms or shorthands used, just the full description of what is being plotted. Also note how easy it is to compare the color of lines and identify the baseline (Bayes) comparison line. Make your plots easy to read and understand.",

To uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\nAnyone found in violation of the Standard will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nClass Attendance\nAttending class is a vital component of the course as it is one of the multiple ways in which you will interact with and learn course material. In person class attendance is therefore expected for this course. For any special circumstances, please reach out to the course instructor.\n\n\nSick absences\nTo keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, please do not come to class if you have cold symptoms. Please inform me of your absence and plan to complete any missed work. Students who encounter short- and long-term medical issues or instances of personal distress or emergency can seek academic support if needed. Recordings of the class will be available for excused absences.\n\n\nAccommodations and accessibility\nIf you need special accommodations due to physical or learning disabilities, medical needs, religious practices, or other reasons, please inform us as soon as possible so we can work to accommodate those needs.\nIf you are a student with a disability and need accommodations for this class, please register with the Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) and provide them with documentation of your disability. SDAO will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to your instructor. Please contact SDAO for more information: sdao@duke.edu or .\n\n\nLate Submissions\nAssignments and projects are due in class by the start of class on the date posted. Late deliverables will ONLY be accepted at the discretion of the instructor. Late Assignments will result in a reduction of 5 points off the grade per day late. Course projects will not be accepted after the deadline. Quizzes will not be accepted after the deadline. While quizzes cannot be made up since the answers are discussed, the lowest two quizzes will be dropped at the end of the semester for each student to accommodate necessary absences and to account for days when we’re off our game. Please reach out to the TA’s or instructor as early as possible to request any special accommodations.\n\n\nCollaboration\nThere will be three modes of collaboration ranging from fully-collaborative group projects, to fully-independent work. The three modes are as follows, and will be indicated throughout the course:\n\nMode 1: Team-based Assignment. Collaboration is expected with every member of the team contributing to a single deliverable. Applies to the Project\nMode 2: Individual Assignment – Collaboration Permitted. Students hand in individual work, but they may work with others if they provide citations of the help they received, such as a list of people who assisted/collaborated with them to produce the final product. Duplication or copying is not permissible, even in part, and constitutes a breach of the honor code. Applies to Assignments\nMode 3: Individual Assignment – No Collaboration Permitted. Students hand in individual work that is completed entirely independent of any discussion or help from other students. Clarifying questions to teaching assistants and instructors are both permissible and encouraged. Applies to Quizzes\n\n\n\nRules for recording course content\nStudent recording recordings of lectures must be permitted by the instructor prior to recording and shall be for private study only. Such recordings shall not be distributed to anyone without authorization by the instructor whose lecture has been recorded. However, the instructor may arrange through the Office of Information Technology to make recorded lectures available to students enrolled in the class on such terms and conditions as he or she prescribes. Redistribution of recorded lectures is prohibited. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board. The full policy on recoding of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available here.",

So it may be useful for idea generation or generic recommendations but it has no ability to creatively and independently generate new insights and make novel connections. These tools may also produce information that is incorrect or biased so students must ensure that material they submit or share has been verified with appropriate sources and is reasonably free of biases.”\n\n\nResponsible use of AI tools\nThere are a number of ways that AI tools can be helpful:\n\nAs a way of detecting spelling and grammar issues (such as with Grammarly)\nAs a way of identifying possible ways to structure writing (although NOT to do the writing for you)\nAs a way of brainstorming ideas (keeping in mind that what is generated by the AI may be incorrect or misleading)\n\nIn this class, the use of AI tools is acceptable WITH CITATION. An appropriate citation would indicate the following information:\n\nWhat AI tool you used (e.g. ChatGPT)\nHow you used it, specifying prompts used (e.g. I checked my writeup for clarity with the prompt, “Review this text {} and improve its clarity”)\n\nAt the end of the day you are responsible for the correctness of everything that you submit, regardless of whether there was an AI tool used in its generation.",

A central component of your project must be a machine learning methodology. It does not have to be one that we’ve explicitly discussed in class as you’re welcome to use the project as an opportunity to learn new topics, although there should be a supervised learning component to your project. The objectives of this project are to…\n\nDevelop deeper competency in applying machine learning methods in practical applications\nGain experience in learning more about a topi beyond what was explicitly discussed, but by building on the foundation you have developed throughout the course which enables you to learn about other machine learning concepts\nIncrease your experience with collaborative data science workflows\nExpand your data science portfolio\n\nIn this project you will use what you’ve learned throughout this course and build on that knowledge and experience to apply the paradigms, algorithms, evaluation tools, and interpretation techniques discussed throughout the course. I strongly encourage you to pick a project that is of genuine interest in some way (e.g. the application, the tools, the dataset, etc.). Learning comes from stretching yourself: this requires that you push yourself into some unfamiliar territory and that is often a challenge and leads to desirable difficulty. Through this struggle is how the best learning happens, but it requires perseverance and that is best achieved when you are able to bring intrinsic motivation to that challenge. Find a topic of interest and embrace the challenge!\nFor this project you will identify a problem you wish to solve using machine learning tools. Identify the experiment you would need to run to evaluate how well you solved it as compared to existing approaches in the field including what metrics to use to evaluate performance.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe project must involve supervised machine learning. You may include concepts we were not able to cover in the course. You may include other concepts at well, but there should be a supervised learning component.\nThe project must be able to be completed within the course of this semester and should be scoped correctly: we encourage you to be ambitious, but please visit office hours if you have questions about project scope.\nEvery project should involve reading about both your application domain and the methods that you’re using. A project on genetics should involve learning about and understanding the concepts that you’re using. You’re expected to develop some domain knowledge related to your problem and demonstrate that in the report.",

Concise 1-4 minute summaries of cutting edge research papers.\n3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson. Mathematical concepts conveyed clearly, intuitively, and visually.\n\nBe sure to practice your presentation, ask your friends (especially those who may not be as technically inclined) for feedback. Do they think it was engaging/easy to follow? Ask them their takeaways: did they get the message you were trying to communicate? Address their feedback to help you ensure the quality of your presentation.

    "text": "Ideas\n\nReproduce the work of a published study and build on it. Reproducing the results of a journal article can be a great way to dive into advanced materials. The goal for a project like this would be to reproduce the study and build on it in some way: test a new hypothesis, adjust the methodology, try it on other data that may present new and interesting challenges. Reproducing papers can be hard, so you’ll want to choose wisely and make clear what your innovation will be. As a starting place, you can explore Papers with Code which typically have papers where the code and the data are both shared, often making reproducing their work simpler. This is the recommended project type for teams in doubt.\nParticipate in an active machine learning competition. Online machine learning competitions are sponsored by organizations with a significantly high interest in a problem that they are investing prize money into finding a solution. Examples of competition platforms include Kaggle, Driven Data, Zindi, AICrowd, etc. If you choose to participate in a competition, it must be an active competition where your team can compete; it cannot be a “sample” competition that is only for learning to use the platform (e.g. the Kaggle Titanic competition, etc.). You will want to learn about the application domain. Note: these competitions often do the hard work of data preprocessing for you, so you are expected to generate a competitive submission - it doesn’t need to top the leaderboard, but you should be in the upper quartile of competitors.\nDesign your own project based on a question, e.g. how well buildings be detected in satellite imagery across diverse geographies? Satellite imagery is enabling us to create functional maps of the world based on the content in the images. Automating building identification could help map global population and analyze global population growth in real-time. However, different parts of the world look different: forests, deserts, plains, etc. Each location looks differently. This may impact the ability to train an algorithm on one location and test on another location. This project uses the INRIA building dataset to investigate the impact of different geographies on the performance of building detection and segmentation techniques using satellite imagery.\nBuild your own tool. Great value can come from making a tool available for use, but building the infrastructure is a challenge. You may want to create a chatbot that creates poetry based on themes that you feed in, or design a search tool that scans satellite data of the Earth for signs of natural disasters. The key here is that your tool will need to be functional and usable by your target audience.",

    "text": "Detailed description\nMachine learning is a collection of useful tools for understanding and making decisions based on data and past experience; it is not a hammer to be applied to every nail, but rather a precision tool to be used when needed. This course will begin with exploring the purpose of machine learning told through a discussion of the types of problems that machine learning can answer: describing, predicting, and strategizing based on data and the tools at our disposal to address these challenges: supervised learning including classification and regression; unsupervised learning including clustering and density estimation; and reinforcement learning. There will be a strong focus on how to formulate a machine learning problem. Central to that formulation will be developing an understanding of how to preprocess data for analysis (e.g. feature extraction/dimensionality reduction, training/validation data sampling), model selection, and performance evaluation with cross validation. The final topic of this course will be a brief overview of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that are emerging in the field.\nThroughout this course, the focus will be on applying algorithms rather than diving deeply into theory. You will be asked to consider the practical issues of machine learning problem solving: challenges of applying machine learning code packages, striving for parsimony (simplicity of models) and interpretability, and ensuring model assumptions are valid for a given problem and dataset. This course will also stress the importance of team-based collaboration, the value of producing fully reproducible and validated results, and tools to help with both such as version control and code repositories.\nCommunicating your results. Data science solutions are only as impactful as the communicator who shares them: therefore communication of your findings will be a core component of this course. Demonstrating competency in data science means (a) exhibiting a working knowledge of technical concepts including programming, statistics, and mathematics and (b) being able to clearly communicate the problem you were trying to solve or question you were trying to answer, why it matters, and how well your analysis worked. You will have opportunities to practice these skills throughout this course in the context of interpreting and sharing the results of your analyses.",

    "text": "Tenet #1: Good learning is active learning\nEveryone who was good at something was once bad at it. Learning comes from practice. No amount of reading or video/lecture watching alone will help you to become good without actively engaging with the material through practice. That is why this entire course is focused on supporting you to actively apply machine learning techniques through the assignments, quizzes, and project. Concept described in Make It Stick.\n\n\nTenet #2: Desirable difficulty leads to meaningful learning\nLearning is most effective when there’s a degree of struggle with the material. “Requiring students to organize new information and to work harder in the initial learning period can lead to greater and deeper learning. Although this struggle, dubbed a desirable difficulty…may at first be frustrating to learner and teacher alike, ultimately it improves long-term retention” (Excerpt from A Concise Guide to Improving Student Learning: Six Evidence-Based Principles and How to Apply Them). Desirable difficulties help you build connections between concepts and learn representations of knowledge (meta-cognition) that, like an index of a book, will increase your ability to creatively connect concepts and think more deeply about the topic. This is also described in Make It Stick.\n\n\nTenet #3: Read, reflect, recall is a pattern for effective learning\nSpaced retrieval and reflection is a key to effective learning. When we learn something, if we don’t use it, the knowledge fades. However, if we return to the material, apply it, create with it, we’re increasing the probability of long-term learning. This is why you will interact with each concept typically 4 times: lectures, readings, quizzes, and assignments, and at least one more time for those concepts involved in the final project. An added benefit of the frequent reflection through quizzes is that it tests your knowledge regularly, helping us to avoid the illusion of knowledge (thinking we know something, when we actually do not).\nReference Brown, P.C., Roediger III, H.L. and McDaniel, M.A., 2014.

    "text": "Programming language: Python\nWe will use Python 3.x. The Anaconda distribution is recommended and comes with the most common packages. Python continues to be an one of the top programming languages and the rich packages in the language make it an excellent choice for machine learning. In particular the Python ecosystem of packages makes it a natural choice for ML including core numerical programming and plotting libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pandas as well as excellent packages for machine learning algorithm development and statistical modeling including Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Pytorch.\n\n\nDevelopment environments: VS Code and Jupyter Notebooks\nJupyter lab or Jupyter notebook will be appropriate for most class assignments. We highly encourage you to use Visual Studio Code, in particular due to the debugging capabilities. There are many configurations that may work for you, but I would recommend begin by gathering ideas in Jupyter Notebooks. Once you have the basic structure of your code worked out, consider moving it to a .py file to make it easier and cleaner to run and build on.\n\n\nGraphics processing units (GPUs)\nGPUs are the workhorses of many modern machine learning algorithms, especially any that involve neural network-based architectures. There will be a small number of assignments that will require additional computation from that of GPUs. For these, we will use Google Colab, which is a free notebook environment that enables access to cloud resources including GPUs. For longer sessions before timeouts, greater RAM, and better GPUs you can optionally upgrade to Colab Pro.\nWe will also be making a limited number of cloud credits available to students later in the semester.",
