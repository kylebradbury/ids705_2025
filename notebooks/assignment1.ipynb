    "## Exercise 2 - Probability Distributions and Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been asked to create a model of wait time for customers at Olivander's Wand Shop. While they strive for the perfect match, there is some cleanup between customers that has been keeping wait times high. They're open 8 hours a day and the maximum wait time is 8 hours (we won't assume it's possible not to be seen, assuming you're willing to wait). Define the continuous random variable $X = \\{\\text{wait time for service as a fraction of 8 hours}\\}$ . This means that $x=1$ represents a full day's wait, or 8 hours, $x=0.5$ represents half a day wait or 4 hours. Additionally, the valid values of $X$ are between 0 and 1 ($0\\leq x \\leq 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by analyzing some data of past visits to the shop to understand the customer wait time experience through our data (2.1-2.2). Then, we'll select a model we hypothesize might fit our situation well and evaluate its properties like mean and variance (2.3-2.7). We'll also evaluate the quality of the fit of the model as compare to our data (2.8-2.11). Lastly, we'll explore how this approach can be used to generate insights (2.12).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reviewing our wait time data\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1. Load and plot a histogram of your wait time data.** The file is `wait_times.csv` in the `data/a1` folder [here on Github](https://github.com/kylebradbury/ids705/tree/main/notebooks/data/a1). I recommend using the simple `np.loadtxt()` function to accomplish this so you can quickly load it in as a numpy array. Remember, the value 1 represents a full 8 hour work day so you should see your data are all in the range of $[0,1]$. Please use 10 bins and limit the bin edges to the range $[0,1]$ (no values should be plotted outside that range).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2. Mean, variance, and standard deviation of the data.** Compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the wait time data. Report the mean and standard deviation in both the original units (in $[0,1]$) and in hours (the variance is unitless).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a model for the wait time distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to review the distribution of the data. The most common distribution is normal, but this doesn't seem normally distributed. Neither does it look uniform. The shape actually looks like it may be exponentially distributed, but truncated at 1. It's not uncommon to have this type of shape in a wait time model, but this introduces a challenge since we can't just use the standard exponential distribution since an exponential distribution is defined on a domain from 0 to infinity, but our data is defined between 0 and 1. Let's create a customized distribution as a model for our data and see how well it represents the key statistics of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, please note the list of equations and identities at the end of this document as they may be useful for several questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3. Probability Density Functions (PDFs).** Compute the value of $\\alpha$ that makes $f_X(x)$ a valid probability density function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_X(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "                \\alpha e^{-x}  & 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\\\\n",
    "                0           & \\text{else}\n",
    "            \\end{cases}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide this value exactly (with no approximation) and also provide and approximate decimal value with a precision to three decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4. Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs).** Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $X$, $F_X(x)$, where $F_X(x)=P(X<x)$ (here, $P(\\cdot)$ represents the probability of the event within the brackets). Be sure to indicate the value of the CDF for ***all*** values of $x\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$. Express your CDF using the variable $\\alpha$ to provide the precise CDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.5. Expected Value.** Compute the expected value of $X$, $E_X[X]$. Provide this value exactly (no approximations and only in terms of $e$ and $\\alpha$) and provide a numerical approximation of the expected value to 3 decimal places. Also provide the approximate number of hours waiting (to 3 decimal places).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.6. Variance and Standard Deviation.** Compute the variance of $X$, $Var(X)$ approximately to 3 significant figures, meaning 3 digits without leading zeros (e.g. 12.3, 0.123, 0.00123, all have 3 significant figures). Using the variance, calculate the standard deviation and express this standard deviation in both the original units and units of hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.7. Plotting your functions.** Create functions to implement your PDF, $f_X(x)$, and CDF, $F_X(x)$, for all possible values of $x$. Using these functions, plot the PDF and CDF on the inverval $-0.5 \\leq x \\leq 1.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating the quality of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.8. Compare the empirical CDF to the modeled CDF.** Plot both of these on the interval $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$. For the empirical CDF of the data from `wait_times.csv`, you can plot the empirical CDF by sorting the data in ascending order, your $x$ values, and assigning the $y$ value as the cumulative fraction of samples that are smaller than or equal to each $x$ value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.9. Calculate the inverse CDF to enable you to generate synthetic data.** Create a numerical simulation of this process. Doing this for a custom PDF is easier than you may think. We typically have access to uniformly distributed samples (through `np.random.rand`), and we can transform these uniform samples into any distribution we wish. To do this, we can input uniform variates through the *inverse* of the CDF. If $U$ is a uniformly distributed random variable and $F_X(x)$ is the CDF of the distribution we're looking to model, then $F_X^{-1}(U)$ will be distributed in the same way as $X$, as shown below in Figure 1.\n",

    "![Synthetic Data Generation](img/copula.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure 1. Demonstrating the process of transforming a uniformly distributed random variable into almost any distribution (here we transform into a normal). Here we show the transformation a sample, $u^{\\ast}$, from a uniform distribution to a sample, $x^{\\ast}$ from a normal distribution by applying the inverse of the CDF of $X$ to $u^{\\ast}$, that is $x^{\\ast} = F_X^{-1}(u^{\\ast})$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the inverse of the CDF, $F_X^{-1}(y)$ (We use the variable $y$ as the input into this function to denote that we're inputting the \"output\" of the CDF into this inverse CDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.10. Generate synthetic data using the inverse CDF by transforming uniform samples.** Once you have your inverse CDF, code it up and use it to create synthetic samples from the last step. To do so, first generate 10,000 samples from the uniform distribution and then feed those uniform variates through the inverse CDF to generate synthetic variates from our wait time model. Using those samples, compute the mean and standard deviation. Present the mean and standard deviation in a table comparing (a) the empirical values computed from `wait_times.csv`, your theoretical model values calculated earlier, and your computed values calculated from your synthetic model. How do they compare?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.11. Run a statistical test to evaluate the goodness of fit of your model to the empirical data from `wait_times.csv`.** To evaluate the goodness of fit of the model to the data, one tool is the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, or simply the KS test. The two-sample version of this test evaluates the maximum distance between two CDFs, each calculated from samples of data. In this case, the null hypothesis states that the samples are drawn from the same distribution. We can conclude that the sample data are well-represented by the reference distribution if we do NOT reject the null hypothesis. If we test at the 5% significant level, then we can conclude that data come from the same distribution if the p-value is greater than 0.05 (we fail to reject the null hypothesis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the sample of data from `wait_times.csv` to the synthetic sample from the model distribution and run the KS test. Also compare the sample data to the uniform distributed data you generated before transforming it into the synthetic samples. For the test use [`scipy.stats.kstest`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.kstest.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the model to understand wait times\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.12. Computing probabilities.** Having a way of generating synthetic data can allow us to easily compute probabilities. Compute the probabilities of the following events using the *synthetic data samples* that you generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Wait time is more than 6 hours\n",
    "2. Wait time is less than 1 hour\n",
    "3. Wait time is less than one additional hour given the client has already been waiting for 3 hours (i.e., the probability of the wait time being less than 4 hours if they have already waited for 3 hours)\n",
    "4. Wait time is between 3 and 5 hours\n",
    "5. What is the 90th percentile of wait times?\n",

    "**3.2. Matrix manipulations and multiplication using Python**. Repeat 3.1, but this time using Python. If you are using a vector, make sure the dimensions of the vector match what you'd expect, for example, matrix $\\mathbf{b}$ is a $[2 \\times 1]$ vector. In NumPy, unless you're specify, you'll like create a one-dimensional array of length 2 rather than a $[2 \\times 1]$ vector if you don't specify - be careful of this potential pitfall. Refer to NumPy's tools for handling matrices. There may be circumstances when Python **will** produce an output, but based on the dimensions of the matrices involved, the linear algebra operation is not possible. ***Note these cases and explain why they occur***. Please provide both the Python code AND the output of that code showing your result. If the output is an error, comment out the code and note that it cannot be computed.\n",

    "**3.3. Vector Norms.** Norms are the effective lengths of vectors. For example, the Euclidean norm, or $L_2$ norm (denoted as $||\\mathbf{\\cdot}||_2$), is the most common of several types of norms. The $L_2$ norm can be calculated for a vector\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x} =  \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**3.4. Orthogonality and unit vectors.** Orthogonal vectors are frequently used in machine learning in topics such as Principal Components Analysis and feature engineering for creating decorrelated features. Knowing what an orthogonal or orthonomal basis is for a space is an important concept. Find all values of unit vectors, $\\mathbf{d}_3$, that complete an orthonormal basis in a three-dimensional Euclidean space along with the two vectors: $\\mathbf{d}_1 =  \\begin{bmatrix} 2^{-1/2} \\\\ -2^{-1/2} \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{d}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For review, vector $\\mathbf{x}_1$ is orthonormal to vector $\\mathbf{x}_2$ if (a) $\\mathbf{x}_1$ is orthogonal to vector $\\mathbf{x}_2$ AND $\\mathbf{x}_1$ is a unit vector. Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular, which implies that their inner product is zero. A unit vector is of length 1 (meaning its $L_2$ norm is 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.5. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues**. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are useful for numerous machine learning algorithms, but the concepts take time to solidly grasp. They are used extensively in machine learning including in Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and clustering algorithms. For an intuitive review of these concepts, explore this [interactive website at Setosa.io](http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/). Also, the series of linear algebra videos by Grant Sanderson of 3Brown1Blue are excellent and can be viewed on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). For these questions, numpy may once again be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Python, calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of matrix $\\mathbf{B}=  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "2 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n",
    "3 & 5 & 6 \n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "2. Choose one of the eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs, $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\lambda$, and show that $\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v}$. This relationship extends to higher orders: $\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda^2 \\mathbf{v}$\n",
    "3. Show that the eigenvectors are orthogonal to one another (e.g. their inner product is zero - just compute the inner product and show it is approximately 0). This is true for eigenvectors from real, symmetric matrices. In three dimensions or less, this means that the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other. Typically we use the orthogonal basis of our standard x, y, and z, Cartesian coordinates, which allows us, if we combine them linearly, to represent any point in a 3D space. But any three orthogonal vectors can do the same. This property is used, for example, in PCA to identify the dimensions of greatest variation."
