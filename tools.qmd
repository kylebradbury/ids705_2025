### Programming language: Python
We will use Python 3.x. The Anaconda distribution is recommended and comes with the most common packages. Python continues to be an one of the top programming languages and the rich packages in the language make it an excellent choice for machine learning. In particular the Python ecosystem of packages makes it a natural choice for ML including core numerical programming and plotting libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pandas as well as excellent packages for machine learning algorithm development and statistical modeling including Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Pytorch.

### Development environments: VS Code and Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter lab or Jupyter notebook will be appropriate for most class assignments. We highly encourage you to use Visual Studio Code, in particular due to the debugging capabilities. There are many configurations that may work for you, but I would recommend begin by gathering ideas in Jupyter Notebooks. Once you have the basic structure of your code worked out, consider moving it to a .py file to make it easier and cleaner to run and build on.

### Graphics processing units (GPUs)
GPUs are the workhorses of many modern machine learning algorithms, especially any that involve neural network-based architectures. There will be a small number of assignments that will require additional computation from that of GPUs. For these, we will use Google Colab, which is a free notebook environment that enables access to cloud resources including GPUs. For longer sessions before timeouts, greater RAM, and better GPUs you can optionally upgrade to Colab Pro.

We will also be making a limited number of cloud credits available to students later in the semester.
